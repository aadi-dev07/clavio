- **Fallback Authentication:**

- Maintain existing authentication methods (e.g., username/password) as a fallback in case of Google outages.

- **Admin Dashboard:**

- Track Google Login usage metrics (number of signups, logins, etc.).


## Functional Requirements

- *2. Goals and Objectives**

- **Primary Goal:** Enhance user experience by simplifying the login process.

- **Objective 1:** Implement Google Login functionality within the Hackwave-webApp.

- **Target:** Successfully integrate Google Login into the existing authentication flow.

- **Objective 2:** Increase user acquisition and conversion rates.

- **Target:** Increase signup conversion rate by 15% within the first month of launch.

- **Objective 3:** Improve user retention and engagement.

- **Target:** Increase weekly active users (WAU) by 10% within two months of launch.

- **Objective 4:** Enhance security by leveraging Google's authentication infrastructure (if implemented correctly).

- **Target:** Reduce the number of password reset requests by 20% within one month of launch.

- **Objective 5:** Facilitate faster user onboarding.

- **Target:** Reduce the average time to complete the initial onboarding flow by 25%.

- **Google Login Integration:**

- Implement a "Sign in with Google" button on the signup and login pages.

- Utilize OAuth 2.0/OIDC for secure authentication with Google.

- Request necessary user data from Google (email, name, profile picture - *needs confirmation*).

- Handle user consent and data access permissions.


## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:**

- Securely store the client secret.

- Protect against CSRF attacks.

- Implement proper OAuth 2.0/OIDC flow to prevent vulnerabilities.

- Regularly review and update security measures.

- **Performance:**

- Minimize latency during the Google Login process.

- Handle Google API rate limits gracefully.

- Ensure scalability to handle increasing user volume.

- **Accessibility:**

- Ensure the Google Login button and flow are WCAG compliant.

- **Reliability:**

- Implement monitoring and alerting for Google Login functionality.

- Provide a fallback authentication method in case of Google outages.

- **Scalability:**

- The system should be able to handle a significant increase in users without performance degradation.

- **Maintainability:**

- The code should be well-documented and easy to maintain.

- Use a modular architecture to facilitate future enhancements.

- **Usability:**

- The Google Login process should be intuitive and easy to use.

- Provide clear and concise instructions to users.

- **Privacy:**

- Comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.

- Be transparent about data usage.

- Obtain user consent for data access.


## Constraints

- **Budget Limitations:** This is a critical constraint impacting technology choices, development time, and feature scope.  Prioritization of core functionality is essential.

- **Limited Information/Vague Requirements:** The initial description "login using Google" lacks specific details regarding data usage, integration methods, and error handling.

- **Dependency on Google:**  Reliance on Google's authentication services introduces a dependency risk. Changes to Google's APIs or outages could disrupt the login functionality.

- **Early Stage Project & Potential Technical Debt:** The "Hackwave-webApp" repository is in its early stages, potentially leading to integration challenges. The use of AI agents for requirement refinement needs careful monitoring to avoid unnecessary complexity and technical debt. Vague commit messages hinder understanding of the current authentication system.

- **Web Application Scope:** The implementation is limited to browser-based authentication flows, excluding native mobile app implementations.

- **Potential Decrease:** A well-planned and executed implementation can reduce the complexity of managing user authentication and potentially reduce technical debt in the long run.

- **Security:**

- **Potential Improvement:** Leveraging Google's authentication infrastructure *can* improve security if implemented correctly.

- **Potential Degradation:** Improper implementation of OAuth 2.0 or other authentication protocols can introduce significant security vulnerabilities.


## Assumptions

- **Budget Limitations:** The project must be completed within a limited budget.

- **Limited Information/Vague Requirements:** Specific details regarding data usage, integration methods, and error handling need clarification.

- **Dependency on Google:** The functionality relies on Google's authentication services.

- **Early Stage Project & Potential Technical Debt:** The Hackwave-webApp repository is in its early stages, potentially leading to integration challenges.
